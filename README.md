# Help me get these tests to pass please!

I would love to be able to use Cypress for acceptance tests, but my app highly relies on Ember power select.  I don't know why but I can't seem to programmatically select the option, and then have interact with the form that is shown after the DOM changes.

Currently I don't even know why the selectors aren't able to select the DOM nodes that are needed.  I can select them very easily via browser tools.
